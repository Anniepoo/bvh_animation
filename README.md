BVH (BioVision Hierarchical) file format library for SWI-Prolog


This library reads and writes BVH file format, a popular format for
exchanging animation information.

More information about BVH is available at this (University of Wisconsin Graphics Course page)[https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html]. 

The overall format of a BVH file is a series of skeleton definitions, then the number of frames,
the frame time (1/# frames/sec) and then a series of frames.
